# Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-Neural-Networks-by-Combining-CNN-and-LSTM-Models


1. Data Preprocessing and Data Cleaning.
2. Conversion of the Sequential data into Candlestick image patterns of the stock.
3. Organising the Candlestick image patterns to a folder.
4. Visualization of the Stock Market analysis by their trends or Movements ( Up & Down).
5. Predicting the Future stock price using historical data using LSTM.
6. Predicting the future stock price using CNN - LSTM Hybrid model for Sequential and Candlestick image patterns as, Candlestick patterns describes the movements and trends of Stock 
   prices will more contribute in the Predictions.
7. Saving the Hybrid model
8. Hybrid model Contributes in Accurate Stock Price Predictions.
9. Comparing the LSTM and Hybrid CNN - LSTM Model Stock Price Prediction using Mean absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

10.Performance Metrics for CNN - LSTM Model such as Mean Absolute Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MAE), R2 score.
