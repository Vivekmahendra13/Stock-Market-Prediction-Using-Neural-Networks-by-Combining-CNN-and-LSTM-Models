Data Preprocessing and Data Cleaning.
Conversion of the Sequential data into Candlestick image patterns of the stock.
Organising the Candlestick image patterns to a folder.
Visualization of the Stock Market analysis by their trends or Movements ( Up & Down).
Predicting the Future stock price using historical data using LSTM.
Predicting the future stock price using CNN - LSTM Hybrid model for Sequential and Candlestick image patterns as, Candlestick patterns describes the movements and trends of Stock prices will more contribute in the Predictions.
Saving the Hybrid model
Hybrid model Contributes in Accurate Stock Price Predictions.
